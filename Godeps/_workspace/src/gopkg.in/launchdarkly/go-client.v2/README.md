LaunchDarkly SDK for Go
===========================

[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/launchdarkly/go-client.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/launchdarkly/go-client)

Quick setup
-----------

1. Install the SDK with the `go` tool:

        go get github.com/launchdarkly/go-client

2. Import the LaunchDarkly client:

        import ld "github.com/launchdarkly/go-client"

2. Create a new LDClient with your SDK key:

        ld_client := ld.MakeClient("YOUR_SDK_KEY")

Your first feature flag
-----------------------

1. Create a new feature flag on your [dashboard](https://app.launchdarkly.com)
2. In your application code, use the feature's key to check wthether the flag is on for each user:

        key := "user@test.com"
        show_feature := ld_client.BoolVariation("your.flag.key", ld.User{Key: &key,}, false)
        if (show_feature) {
            # application code to show the feature
        } else {
            # the code to run if the feature is off 
        }

Check out our [documentation](http://docs.launchdarkly.com) for in-depth instructions on configuring and using LaunchDarkly. You can also head straight to the [complete reference guide for this SDK](http://docs.launchdarkly.com/v1.0/docs/go-sdk-reference).

Testing
-------

We run integration tests for all our SDKs using a centralized test harness. This approach gives us the ability to test for consistency across SDKs, as well as test networking behavior in a long-running application. These tests cover each method in the SDK, and verify that event sending, flag evaluation, stream reconnection, and other aspects of the SDK all behave correctly.

Contributing
------------

We encourage pull-requests and other contributions from the community. We've also published an [SDK contributor's guide](http://docs.launchdarkly.com/v1.0/docs/sdk-contributors-guide) that provides a detailed explanation of how our SDKs work.

About LaunchDarkly
-----------

* LaunchDarkly is a continuous delivery platform that provides feature flags as a service and allows developers to iterate quickly and safely. We allow you to easily flag your features and manage them from the LaunchDarkly dashboard.  With LaunchDarkly, you can:
    * Roll out a new feature to a subset of your users (like a group of users who opt-in to a beta tester group), gathering feedback and bug reports from real-world use cases.
    * Gradually roll out a feature to an increasing percentage of users, and track the effect that the feature has on key metrics (for instance, how likely is a user to complete a purchase if they have feature A versus feature B?).
    * Turn off a feature that you realize is causing performance problems in production, without needing to re-deploy, or even restart the application with a changed configuration file.
    * Grant access to certain features based on user attributes, like payment plan (eg: users on the ‘gold’ plan get access to more features than users in the ‘silver’ plan). Disable parts of your application to facilitate maintenance, without taking everything offline.
