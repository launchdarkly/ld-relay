# Change log

All notable changes to the LaunchDarkly Go SDK will be documented in this file. This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org).

## [4.0.0] - 2018-05-10

### Changed:
- To reduce the network bandwidth used for analytics events, feature request events are now sent as counters rather than individual events, and user details are now sent only at intervals rather than in each event. These behaviors can be modified through the LaunchDarkly UI and with the new configuration option `InlineUsersInEvents`. For more details, see [Analytics Data Stream Reference](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/v2.0/docs/analytics-data-stream-reference).
- When sending analytics events, if there is a connection error or an HTTP 5xx response, the client will try to send the events again one more time after a one-second delay.
- The `Close` method on the client now conforms to the `io.Closer` interface.

### Added:
- The new global `VersionedDataKinds` is an array of all existing `VersionedDataKind` instances. This is mainly useful if you are writing a custom `FeatureStore` implementation. (Thanks, [mlafeldt](https://github.com/launchdarkly/go-client/pull/117)!)


## [3.1.0] - 2018-03-19
### Added
- Convenience functions `NewUser` and `NewAnonymousUser`, for creating a user struct given only the key. (Thanks, [mlafeldt](https://github.com/launchdarkly/go-client/pull/109)!)
### Fixed
- In the Redis feature store, fixed a synchronization problem that could cause a feature flag update to be missed if several of them happened in rapid succession.
- Fixed errors in the Readme example code. (Thanks, [mlafeldt](https://github.com/launchdarkly/go-client/pull/110)!)

## [3.0.0] - 2018-02-19

### Added
- Support for a new LaunchDarkly feature: reusable user segments.
- The mechanism by which the client retrieves feature and segment data from the server is now customizable through an interface, `UpdateProcessor`. This will be used in future to support test fixtures.

### Changed
- The `FeatureStore` interface has been changed to support user segment data as well as feature flags. Existing code that uses `InMemoryFeatureStore` or `RedisFeatureStore` should work as before, but custom feature store implementations will need to be updated.
- Logging is now done through an interface, `Logger`, instead of directly referencing `log.Logger`. Existing code that uses `log.Logger` should still work as before.



## [2.3.0] - 2018-01-31

### Changed
- When evaluating a feature flag, if the client has not yet fully initialized but you are using a Redis store that has already been populated, the client will now use the last known feature data from Redis rather than returning a default value.
- In polling mode, the minimum polling interval is now 30 seconds. Smaller configured values will be adjusted up to the minimum.
- The streaming client will no longer reconnect after detecting an invalidated SDK key.
- Added a build tag, `launchdarkly_no_redis`, which allows building without the Redis dependency.

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where a previously deleted feature flag might be considered still available.


## [2.2.3] - 2017-12-21

### Added

- Allow user to stop user attributes from being sent in analytics events back to LaunchDarkly.  Set `PrivateAttributeNames` to a list of attributes to avoid sending, or set `AllAttributesPrivate` to `true` to send no attributes.

### Changed

- Accept an interface for the `Logger` configuration option (thanks @ZiaoGeorgeJiang).

## [2.1.0] - 2017-11-16

### Added
- Stop processing streaming events and errors after `Close()`.


## [2.0.0] - 2016-08-08
### Added
- Support for multivariate feature flags. New methods `StringVariation`, `JsonVariation` and `IntVariation` and `Float64Variation` for multivariates.
- New `AllFlags` method returns all flag values for a specified user.
- New `SecureModeHash` function computes a hash suitable for the new LaunchDarkly JavaScript client's secure mode feature.

### Changed
- The `Feature` data model has been replaced with `FeatureFlag`. 

### Deprecated
- The `Toggle` call has been deprecated in favor of `BoolVariation`.
